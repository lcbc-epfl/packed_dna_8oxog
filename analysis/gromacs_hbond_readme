To count how many hbonding interactions are present across a trajectory or how many nearby (within 0.35nm) hbonding possible partners there are use
gmx hbond -f <xtc file> -s <tpr file> -n <index file if needed> -num <name of output file xvg format>

The output will provide in the first column the number of hbonding interactions per frame evalauted. In the second column in the number of possible hbonding partners within 0.35nm. 

You can calculate averages with bash like:
awk '{ sum += $2; n++ } END { if (n > 0) print sum / n; }' <num xvg file> 
awk '{ sum += $3; n++ } END { if (n > 0) print sum / n; }' <num xvg file>
